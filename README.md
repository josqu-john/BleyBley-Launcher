This was my one of my first real Projects. A replacement for the DLC/Mod-Launcher for Mount and Blade Warband. The Original Laucher would not work under Linux so I made my own. (it actually just changes one Line of Code if I remember correctly) Its here mostly for nostalgic Reasons 
### NO LONGER MAINTAINED

This project is no longer being maintained or updated in any way.

# _BleyBley-Launcher[DEAD]_

## *About* 
*kinda dead.*
*First Ruby Project so extremmly bad written.*


Small Ruby launcher for Mount and and Blade Warband 
Version: ALPHA 0.6
Website :Josqu.de

Work only on Debian but you can write it yourself for Suse or other!

The finish of this little project is to create a small alternative Ruby Launcher for "Mount and Blade Warband"
because the native Linux-Launcher is extremly bugy on Linux.

## *How to install!*
1. Download the BleyBley Launcher from josqu.de or Github.
2. unzip the zip.
3. start the install.sh script via Konsole.
4. Finally start the start.sh.
